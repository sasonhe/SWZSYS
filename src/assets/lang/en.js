In the innovation and manufacturing of new antitumor drugs, he is one of the major inventors for three new drug candidates that are in clinical studies phase 1 to 3, all of which have independent intellectual property rights. In addition, three new drugs are applying for clinical trials, and another batch of drugs are in the phase of pre-clinical studies. He has applied over 160 domestic and international patents, including 42 issued domestic and international patents. In the exploration of drug’s mechanism of action and the study of biological markers, he has systematically explained the mechanism of action for topoisomerase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors and other antitumor composites or drug candidates, and discovered several important tumor markers. He has published over 240 SCI essays, which have been cited for over 4,000 times. He received two 2nd Prizes of State Natural Science Award, the 2nd Prize of Shanghai Natural Science Progress Award, two 1st Prizes of Shanghai Technology Progress Award, Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation Scientific Progress Award, the 1st Prize of Wu Jieping Medical Science Award, Paul Jansson Pharmaceutical Science Award and Shanghai Top 10 Scientific Elites Award.

In 2002, he was awarded Doctor’s Degree of Naturwissenschaften by Leuven Catholic University in Belgium. He was elected as the member of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2005. His main research concerns the polymerization kinetics theory, the synthesis and application of hyperbranched polymers, the modification of carbon nanotubes, and supramolecular Supermoleculeself-assembly, etc. He proposed the mathematical relationship between molecular structural parameters such as polymer MWD and polymerization conditions. Based on the activity difference between different radical polymerization groups, he establishes a new method of massively producing hyperbranched polymer through the AB2 intermediate yielded from commercially available bi-component in situ monomers; employing this method, he has synthesized a series of complex new hyperbranched polymers. Based on the self-condensing ring-opening polymerization of oxygen heterocycle monomers, he has synthesized a novel type of amphiphilic multiarm hyperbranched copolymers with a hyperbranched core synthesized with polyoxyethylene; then he proposes its molecular stack model and the macro molecular self-assembly mechanism, and achieved the macro molecular self-assembly and supramolecular self-assembly in the lab. He developed the unsteady-state kinetics theory for polymerization, and established the method to calculate polymer molecular parameters based on the reaction mechanism and conditions. He won First Prize of Shanghai Scientific and Technological Process (Basic research) in 1998 and the 4th Prize of State Natural Science Award in 1999.</p><p>In 1989, he was awarded the 2nd Prize of Sate Natural Science Award as a co-originator of “Statistics Theory of Polymer Condensation, Polyaddition and Cross-linking Reactions”. Working with his partners, he deducted the universal formula for the mean square radius of gyration and built the polymer configuration-conformation statistics theory. Working with his students, he proposed the method of massively producing hyperbranched polymer through commercially available monomers, which solved the problems of anti-peroxidation and anti-hydroxidation of the proton exchange membrane for non-fluorinated polymers, discovered non-toxic and affordable ligands for atom transfer radical polymerization, and discovered that the phase of 31-spiral conformation would change upon reaching the threshold length during the temperature drop of polypropylene melt. His theoretical research has been widely cited by SCI magazines. Dr. Yan was an editorial board member of Macromolecular Theory and Simulation (citation impact score: 1.573SCI Impact Factor)from 1993 to 2002.</p>"
